# configs

My configs for ubuntu server initial setup

# Usage

```bash
git clone https://github.com/AbnerTeng/configs.git

cd configs

chmod +x setup.sh
./setup.sh
```

# Notice

I suggest to clone this repo into `$HOME/git`, so If you clone to another directory, please slightly modify the `NVIM_SOURCE` and `DOTFILES_SOURCE` inside `setup.sh`
