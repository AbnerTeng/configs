# configs

My configs for LinuxOS (ubuntu) / MacOS initial setup

# Usage

1.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/AbnerTeng/configs.git && cd configs
```

2. Pre-check for must-have tools

```bash
chmod +x pre-check.sh && ./pre-check.sh
```

3. Setup the dev environment

```bash
chmod +x setup.sh && ./setup.sh
```

# Notice

1. The neovim config is based on my personal preference, so there might be smth need API key (GitHub copilot, wakatime, etc.). Remove it if you don't need it.
2. `nvtop` is not well-prepared, figuring out...
